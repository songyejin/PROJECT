CHAPTER4. OPERATOR
Learning an operator is learning instruction.
An order is an operator.
Data that is intended to be operated by operator is called operand.
You don't have to be nervous because it's similar to mathematical symbols.

1 Arithmetic Operator
These are all arithmetic operators. Use two operands. 
  +  Plus
  -  Minus
  *  Multiplication
  /  Division
  %% Rest
  ex) a+b a-b

CHAPTER4. OPERATOR
2 Assignment Operator
Use =symbol. It saves the result of the right expression in the left variable.
(Never interpret it as the same thing! An operator who means the same will soon learn.)
 ex)a=b

CHAPTER4. OPERATOR
3 ++ Operator and -- operator
These operators Increse or decrease the operand 1 by 1
Both use one operand.
These used  in front of the operand, or can be used back of the operand.
If ++operator used in front of the operand, it increased and ready for other operator.
And if ++ operator used back of the operand, it ready for other operator and increased. 
++
--
ex) ++a a++ --a a--

4 Relational Operator
When you need to execute a command according to the conditions, what you need is a relational operator.
a<b If a is less than b, 1(True). If not, 0(False).
a=<b If a is less or same as b, 1(True). If not, 0(False).
a==b If a is same as b, 1(True). If not, 0(False).
a!=b If a is different from b, 1(True). If not , 0(False).

5 Logical Operator
a&&b (AND)  If all true, 1(True). If not, 0(False).
a||b (OR)  If either of them is true, 1(True). If not, 0(False).
!a (NOT)  If a is false, 1(True). If not, 0(False).
