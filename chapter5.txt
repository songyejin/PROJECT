CHAPTER5. CHOICE STATEMENT //pg.1

5.1 IF STATEMENT

If you write an if statement, you can pick a statement to execute according to the condition.

(1) Basic form of if statement
if(Conditional expression)    choice statement;
if conditional is true, execute statement. If false, do nothing

if (a>10)   ->conditional expression 
{ 
     b=a        ->Execution Statement
} 

If the sentence to be executed is two or more sentences, it must be enclosed in curly braces.
~
(2) if ~ else statement   //pg.2
The if ~ else statement is used when you must choose one or the other

if(a>=0)    ->conditional expression
{
    a=1;    ->execution Statement1
} 
else 
{ 
    a=-1;    ->execution Statement2 
}

The conditional is not used in the if-else statement else.
~
(3) if ~ else if ~ else statement   //pg.3
If you must select one of three or more statements, use an if ~ else if ~ else statement.

if(a>0)      ->Conditional expression1
{ 
    b=1      ->Execution Statement1
} 
else if(a==0) ->Conditional expression2
{ 
    b=2;      ->Execution Statement2 
} 
else
{ 
    b+3;      ->Execution Statement3
} 

If the sentence to run under each condition is more than two sentences, enclose it with curly brackets.
The result of the previous condition is reflected because it checks the conditional expression in order.
~
5.2 Use of if statement and switch ~ case statement   //pg.4

Overlaying an if statement

if(a>10)    ->Conditional expression 
{ 
    if(b>=0)  -Execution Statement
    { 
        b=1;
    } 
    else
    {
        b=-1; 
    } 
}
~
SWITCH ~ CASE STATEMENT    //pg.5

switch(conditional expression
{ 
    case invariable 1: 
        execution statement 1; 
        break;
    case invariable 2:
        execution statement 2;
        break;"); 
    default:
        execution statement;
        break; 
} 

Conditional expressions use only integer expressions, and the case involves break.
If there is no case invariable that matches the conditional expression, it skips to default.
'break' can be omitted if necessary.
The switch ~ case statement can sometimes be replaced with an if statement to achieve the same result.
