CHAPTER1. C PROGRAMMIG.

1.1 THIS IS C LANGUAGE.
C Language is a programming language.
And the programming language is a communication medium used to communicate with computers.
*What is a programming language?.
It means the promised language that humans and compilers can understand.
*What is the role of the compiler?.
It translates programs written in programming languages into machine language so that the computer can understand them.
In addition, the translation itself is called compilation.
Advantages of C language.
1.The c language has process-oriented characteristics. It does not take long to get used to it.
2.Programs written in the c language are portable.
3.Programs implemented in the c language show good performance.

1.2 Completion process of C program   //pg2

Overall understanding of C program completion process
                  1.programming

                       V
                  4.create an executable file

1.3 Entering and Compiling the Source Code //pg3

Now let's write our first program. 
Simply enter the program code that follows.
Note that you do not know anything about C yet, so you do not have the ability to cope with errors. 
Therefore, care must be taken to avoid typos.
